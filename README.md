# Blomst ğŸŒ¸

Swift wrapper of the BLS12-381 signature library [`blst`](https://github.com/supranational/blst) that was written in C/assembly.

## Etymology
*"Blomst"* is ğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡ª Swedish for *"blossom"* ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§, trying to follow the word play for BLS, with the fun fact that "om" (in the middle of the word *blomst*) is ğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡ª Swedish for *"if"* ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§, so "if you wanna do BLS in Swift, use Blomst".
